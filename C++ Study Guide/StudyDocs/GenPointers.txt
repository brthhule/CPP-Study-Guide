							Pointers to structs
Like any other type, structures can be pointed by its own type of pointers:
struct movies_t {
 string title;
 int year;
};
movies_t amovie;
movies_t * pmovie;
pmovie = &amovie;
pmovie -> title is equivalent to (*pmovie).title, but not *pmovie.title, which is equivalent to *(pmovie.title)

a.b, evaluates member b of object a
a->b, evaluates member b of object pointed by a, equivalent to (*a).b
*a.b, evaluates value pointed by member b of object a, equivalent to *(a.b)

Nested structs:
struct movies_t {
 string title;
 int year;
};
struct friends_t {
 string name;
 string email;
 movies_t favorite_movie;
 } charlie, maria;
friends_t * pfriends = &charlie;

charlie.name
maria.favorite_movie.title
charlie.favorite_movie.year
pfriends->favorite_movie.year
